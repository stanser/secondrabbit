All files should be started in different terminals.

1. Start broker_index.js to send messages. Parameters are following: 

    1) {integer} countTotal - total amount of calls have to be emulated 
        One call includes two messages: 1 start and 1 stop
    2) {integer} countAtOnce - how many calls have to be emulated during 1 iteration
    3) {integer} countOfStartLess - how many calls should be without start
    4) {integer} countOfNegativeDuration - how many calls should have negative duration
    5) {integer} interval - in ms, interval for sending

    Every parameter accepts default value if isn't specified.
    
2. Start cons_start.js to create Consumer for listening call.start messages (inserting in DB)
3. Start cons_stop.js to create Consumer for listening and processing call.stop messages 
(selecting matching start msg, merging, updating doc in Couch);

4. Than restart broker_index.js so many times as you want.



Happy spending time =)))
